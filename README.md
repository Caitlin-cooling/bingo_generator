# Bingo Card Generator
This is a small script that takes an array, will shuffle the array, then create a csv file with the contents that can then be imported to Excel and a Bingo sheet can be created.

### To Use
1. Instantiate the Generator class with 3 arguments: the words that you want to display, the length of reach row that you would like and how many copies you want
2. Run the file `ruby generate_bingo_card.rb`
3. The new file will be in your repo
